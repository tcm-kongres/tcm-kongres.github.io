        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <h6>TCM diet and herbs in strengthening Immune system</h6>
		<p>
		Living in a modern era with full of different pollution, radiations, chemical products and negative emotions, everyone needs to build up
		a strong immune system to be able to cope with these environments.
		</p>
		<p>
		Theoretically the immune system, which is made up of special cells, proteins, tissues, and organs, should defend people against germs and
		microorganisms properly, i.e. cleaning the toxin, maintaining a good health and preventing infections. Once immune system fails to carry out
		these functions, various diseases follow. Disorders of the immune system could cause either immunodeficiency disorders, autoimmune disorders,
		or allergic disorders, even cancers. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Based on the theory of Yin and Yang, five elements, Zang-Fu organs and meridian systems, and guided by the theory of TCM syndrome differentiation
		and treatment, administration of certain Chinese herbs or following some dietary recipes could be beneficial to strengthen the immune system so
		as to promote the health, manage some chronic diseases and improve the quality of human lives. In order to achieve above effects, TCM focuses
		the emphasis of regulation in Yin and Yang, harmonization of Qi and Blood, and stabilization of internal Zang-Fu organs, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
		TCM has a long history of health care through combination of herbs and some diet on purpose. Five tastes and natures of herbs are taken into
		the consideration during this procedure of health care.
		</p>
		<p>
		In this half day seminar, common herbs, herbal formulas and some dietary recipes to strengthen the immune system are briefly introduced,
		demonstrating not only some features of TCM methods, but also the prefunding knowledge and background of this unique way of health care.
		These common and standard herbs are easy to obtain and prepare, and the dietary materials are also available in daily market. Besides,
		the preparation of these procedures is relative simple and practical.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h6>Understand and management of Leaky Gut syndrome with TCM</h6>
		<p>
		Although leaky gut syndrome, somewhat new to the modern medical world, is at this moment not fully recognized as a real condition by mainstream
		medical professionals, it may be associated with multiple health problems.
		</p>
		<p>
		Leaky gut syndrome is a condition in which the lining of the intestines become damaged, causing, or increased intestinal permeability with undigested
		food particles, toxic waste products and bacteria to leak through the intestines and flood the blood stream.
		</p>
		<p>
		The clinical symptoms vary from fatigue, digestive problems, joint pain, insomnia, low libido, even mild-grade depression to hormone imbalances,
		a weakened immune system, allergic reactions and even relative severe mental disorders. Because it's causes can be so varied and its symptoms so
		numerous, it is often confused with irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease.
		</p>
		<p>
		Common its diet is a strict elimination diet that contains grains, pasteurized dairy, starchy vegetables and refined carbs, which has been widely
		criticized for its restrictive regimen.
		</p>
		<p>
		Based upon the analysis from TCM point of view, attention should be paid to some different Zang-Fu organs in order to rebalance the body so as to
		regulate the intestines to produce the enzymes, restore intestinal permeability and build a proper digestion.
		</p>
		<p>
		During the presentation, its etiology, pathology and TCM treatment, including herbal prescription, acupuncture and diets are introduced accordingly.
		Both beginners and advanced TCM practitioners are welcome to join to observe the witness of TCM wisdom.
